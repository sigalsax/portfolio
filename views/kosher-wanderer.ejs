    <p class="section-description">The Kosher Wander is an informative travel blog that provides recipes and guidelines on how to maintain a strict diet while traveling (Kosher, vegetarian, gluten-free, etc). From her stories, recipes, and nuggets of advice, the author hopes to show that traveling to remote places  should not require you to compromise on a restricted diet.</p>

      <p class="subsection">Build a website!</p>
      <p class="section-description">The Kosher Wanderer needed a site that was not only dynamic, but responsive and user-friendly. Because the author wanted to reach a wide audience, it was important to produce useful content with lots of colour. This project was complex because the site was to have two messages; 1) travel blog and 2) recipes. After several meetings of white-boarding, I began outlining the User Flow.</p>

        <p class="section-description">After approval of the siteâ€™s user flow, we reviewed market strategies. It was decided to open a Instagram channel called @thebaketress. There, the author would be able to post her latest adventures and keep her followers close, to be accessed instantaneously. Upon approval of both, the actual implementation of the site began. I built out the entire front-end of the site using HTML and CSS and the raw code has been pushed to my private repository on Github. The hosting was taken care of a third-party provider.</p>
        <p class="section-description">Moving forward, we spoke about the installation of an SSL Certificate if we decide to eventually venture into accepting credit cards for subscriptions, selling recipes, or merch.</p>
