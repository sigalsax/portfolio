          <h2 class="subsection">Build a website!</h2>
          <p class="section-description">The Kosher Wanderer needs a site that was not only dynamic, but responsive and user-friendly. Because she wants to reach a wide audience, it is important to produce useful content with lots of colour. The site is to have two themes; 1) travel blog and 2) recipes. After several meetings of white-boarding, I began outlining the User Flow.</p>

          <p class="section-description">After approval of the siteâ€™s user flow, we reviewed market strategies. It was decided to open a Instagram channel called @thebaketress. There, the Kosher Wanderer would be able to post her latest adventures and grow her following. Upon approval of both, the actual implementation of the site began. I built out the front-end using HTML and CSS and the raw code has been pushed to my private repository on Github. The hosting was taken care of a third-party provider.</p>
          <p class="section-description">Moving forward, we spoke about running the site over HTTPS if we eventually wanted to venture into commerce, accepting credit cards for subscriptions, selling recipes, or merch.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">The Challenges</h3>
        <p class="section-description">
        We learn through application. This was my first client and my first project where I was able to apply what I have learned through hours of self-teaching. With that, the most natural, challenge was meeting clients expectations and doing so on time. As a developer in this ever-changing industry, it is critical for our own <i>personal growth</i> to educate ourselves on the most up-to-date practices.
        </p>
        <p class="section-description">
        Many times I found myself at a crossroad. Do I code according to my most comfortable practices? Or do I challenge myself to be better? One such crossroads was whether to make this site a responsive one. Looking back, the answer was a simple one- well, duh. But in that moment, that was not in the original agreement between client and freelancer. I wanted to be better and therefore I was. The site is now "mediatagified". upon project completion, I was happy that I didn't settle. I am happy I went back to add those details that to the client and their audience seem outwardly trivial, but in fact do add life to the product and to their business.
        </p>
        <p class="section-description">
        I sometimes look at my own code and think, what was I thinking? I have this urge to just go back and change just about everything- the spacing, the theme, the margins, the font choice. I found it to be important to realize that each project represents a certain stage in your learning process.
