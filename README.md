### Portfolio

This repository holds the source code for my portfolio site! It consists of information and in-depth descriptions of past projects, information about me, about how to get into contact.

### Notes for Editing

This project uses the Sass extension for CSS. To track Sass changes and update the CSS when there is a change, run command ```sass --watch input.scss:output.css```
